        <p>Oil is the lifeblood of your car. If the wrong kind is used, the engine is at risk of
          increased wear and corrosion. Formation of blockages can also lead to engine seizure. By
          putting Shell Helix oil in the engine, you can carry on motoring with confidence and
          experience the feeling that your car has just been serviced – all for less than the cost of
          a tank of fuel.</p>
